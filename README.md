# cursed

A collection of examples of or ideas for cursed language model code. 
Please take a look at our ideas to submit your own, or add a pull request
to include a link to the idea (stored on your own repo) or directly
to our repo (you can put your code here).

## What is cursed code?

Cursed code is code that is creative, unexpected, foolish, 
or otherwise intended simply for play.

Cursed code is an abomination, but the core value of 
cursed code is that it lets us experiment with the 
boundaries of a tool.

Language models and structured text are so incredibly 
new that we haven't really begun to play with these boundaries.

The very best cursed code shows us something cool, interesting, and quirky about the tools that we use. It shows us how to build real things too, by demonstrating what it is actually possible to construct.

## Ideas for cursed language model code

These are all fair game! We'd absolutely love to see people tinker
with these.

- An [SCP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) entry generator. 
  [Here's a good example](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-003) of 
  an SCP entry.
- Related to the SCP one, 
  [generating infohazards](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-001). 
  Infohazards are ideas that are dangerous to know about. 
  Kind of a fun sci-fi style project.

## Examples of cursed language model code

- [worldsim](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com/) is a great example of cursed code. It lets you explore a world that doesn't exist in a way that invites constant curiousity. Amazing work by the Nous team.
- [Python.jl](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2024/talk/ZH3JN3/) in the Julia world overrode the Julia REPL to attempt to evaluate python expressions before Julia ones, which made this hideous (but cool) python + julia nightmare blend. It also surprisingly works very well.
- [this rust code](https://github.com/loyston500/cursed-codes/blob/main/rust/hello.rs) is gross as hell
- [rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/) is an esoteric programming language where you write code in the form of hair metal power ballads
- [websim](https://websim.ai/) is an AI-powered platform that randomly invents webpages. Type in a URL, get the language model's best guess of what that webpage would look like. It's a playground.
- [gcc-torture](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite/tree/main/SingleSource/Regression/C/gcc-c-torture) are tests playing with the C language to test compilers to the edge.
- [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/) is a social network for building and sharing visual javascript demos limited to 140 characters. See the impressive creations crammed into so few characters, and play around with your own code!
