## Description

**Physical Appearance:** N/A

**Anomalous Properties:** SCP-6666 is a piece of software designed to ran on modern operating systems, presenting itself as a seemingly innocuous text application. When a user types a word into the application, the software will return a list of anagrams of that word. Upon further use, the software begins to generate increasingly complex anagrams, eventually producing phrases and sentences.

**Origin:** SCP-6666 was initially discovered on a file-sharing website in 2018. Researchers traced the file to its source, which led to the discovery of a small underground organization dedicated to spreading the software through online forums and chat rooms."
