# SCP-902

## Item #: SCP-902

## Object Class: [Euclid]

## Special Containment Procedures

SCP-902 is to be contained within a thick, airtight steel chamber measuring 5 meters x 5 meters x 3 meters. The chamber is to be housed within Site-17's Special Containment Unit-23, and should be reinforced with lead-lined walls.

Access to SCP-902 is to be restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Camera surveillance and motion detectors are to be installed throughout Special Containment Unit-23.

Personnel designated to enter SCP-902's containment chamber must wear full-body protective suits equipped with separate air supply units. Upon entry, personnel must remain within a safe distance of 10 meters from SCP-902. 

SCP-902 is to be stored within a Faraday cage to prevent any possible electronic interference.

## Description:

SCP-902 appears to be a large, irregularly shaped gemstone. The gemstone is translucent, featuring a gradual color gradient ranging from a deep blue to a bright purple. It measures approximately 45 centimeters in length, 35 centimeters in width, and 25 centimeters in height.

When exposed to any form of electromagnetic radiation, SCP-902 envelopes the area in a highly unstable force field. The force field manifests as various forms of electronic equipment malfunctioning and/or being destroyed. The force field dissipates after approximately 3 minutes of sustained exposure to SCP-902.

SCP-902 was recovered from a collapsed ore mine in ████, ██. An eyewitness at the site claimed to have seen a blinding light emanating from the mine before it collapsed.

SCP-902 was initially contained within a standard secured locker. On ██/██/████, a D-Class personnel assigned to test SCP-902 escaped containment, resulting in significant damage to Special Containment Unit-12 and the malfunction of multiple electronic devices within Site-17.

## Notes:

Further research is recommended to determine the potential applications of SCP-902's anomalous properties for defensive purposes.
