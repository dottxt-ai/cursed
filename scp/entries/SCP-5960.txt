## Addenda

### Addendum SCP-5960.1: Diary of Agent ████

Entry 1: Today is my first day of duty at SCP-5960. It's a surreal feeling to know that I'm part of a team tasked with observing a neighborhood full of people turning into animals. It's like being in a sci-fi movie. Entry 2: Today was my first undercover operation where I had to enter the neighborhood as one of them. Not going to lie, it was fascinating to see myself transform into a raven. I felt an overwhelming sense of freedom while soaring in the sky. However, it's disconcerting to see my family and friends living this strange life every day. Entry 3: I’ve been noticing patterns in the transformations. It seems that individuals with higher stress levels tend to transform into reptiles like lizards, whereas those that are more relaxed transform into birds.
