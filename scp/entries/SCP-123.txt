# SCP-123

## Item #: SCP-123

## Object Class: [Euclid]

## Special Containment Procedures

SCP-123 is to be housed within a 5-meter by 5-meter airtight chamber constructed of reinforced concrete. The chamber must be fitted with a tamper-proof electronic lock system.

Access to SCP-123 is restricted to Level 3 personnel with proper clearance. Video surveillance and motion detectors must be active at all times, with the footage being stored for a minimum of two weeks.

All personnel interacting with SCP-123 must wear Level B biohazard suits and full-face respirators. Interaction with SCP-123 is limited to Level 3 personnel only, in pairs.

Any specimens of SCP-123-1 are to be immediately euthanized and incinerated upon discovery. All materials contaminated by SCP-123-1 are to be disposed of using standard hazardous waste protocols.

## Description:

SCP-123 appears to be an intact, human-sized wooden chest, adorned with intricate carvings, locked with a metal clasp. The wood appears to be of an unknown species, black in color and remarkably resistant to most forms of damage.

SCP-123 is capable of spontaneously producing specimens of SCP-123-1, which are humanoid entities composed entirely of some form of virulent fungi. These entities will actively attempt to infect any living beings within 3 meters of their location. SCP-123-1 specimens have a lifespan of approximately 72 hours and will eventually perish. Upon death, they are capable of releasing a fungal spore cloud which can contaminate a 5-meter radius area. Spores will remain dormant for up to 2 weeks before reactivating.

SCP-123 was initially recovered from an abandoned smuggling warehouse on the outskirts of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, during an ongoing investigation into reports of unexplained sickness in the area.

There have been three instances of accidental releases of SCP-123-1 prior to implementation of revised containment procedures. The last incident resulted in the hospitalization of fifteen security personnel and the destruction of the original containment chamber. As a result, the current containment procedures have been established.

## Addendum:

### Addendum SCP-123.1: Addendum 123-1

During a routine inspection of SCP-123, Researcher Rodriguez discovered an inscription on the bottom of the chest, written in an as-yet unidentified dialect of Old Norse. The translation reads: 'The Sleeping Venom, Awake When the Moon Is Red.'

## Notes:

Further study is needed to determine the origins of SCP-123, its connection with the inscription, and whether its anomalous properties can be affected by lunar phases.
