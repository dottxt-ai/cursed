# SCP-673

**Object Class:** Euclid
**Entry Type:** Artifact

## Special Containment Procedures

- **Physical Requirements:** A specially-designed, airtight chamber.
- **Security Measures:** The chamber is to be kept under constant guard and undergo regular security checks.
- **Handling Instructions:** SCP-673 is to be handled only by Level 3 staff or higher, wearing appropriate protective gear. Any exploration of the chamber is prohibited.
- **Additional Precautions:** The chamber is to be kept in a room with a magnetic shielding field that prevents any external sources of magnetism from reaching it.

## Description

**Physical Appearance:** SCP-673 is a roughly spherical object, approximately 17 centimeters in diameter and weighing 1.5 kilograms. Its exterior is a matte, greyish-brown color, and appears to be made of a rough-textured material resembling stone. It has a small, circular hole (approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter) on one side, which serves as its 'mouth'.

**Anomalous Properties:** SCP-673 is capable of spontaneously combusting any non-metal object placed into the hole on its surface. The combustion is almost instantaneous, takes an object to be completely burned to ash in approximately 2 seconds. It appears to be indiscriminate about what objects it targets, and has shown no signs of satiation or fatigue.

**Origin:** SCP-673 was recovered from a forest in ████, China, where it was found in the remnants of a small wooden shack. There were no surviving witnesses or records suggesting the origin or purpose of the object.

**Relevant History:** A Foundation team initially attempted to contain SCP-673 in a standard containment cell. However, upon placing SCP-673 inside, it caused a catastrophic explosion, destroying the containment cell and<|im_start|> assistant<|im_start|> assistant  and killing three Foundation personnel. Since then, SCP-673 has been contained in its specially designed airtight chamber, which prevents any non-metal objects from reaching it.

## Addenda

### Addendum SCP-673.1: Addendum 673-1

Experiment Log-673: Since containment in the airtight chamber, research has been conducted to determine the limits and nature of SCP-673's anomalous properties. Test substances have included paper, cloth, plastics, and biological materials. SCP-673 has shown no resistance to any non-metal object placed in its 

### Addendum SCP-673.2: Addendum 673-2

Memo: Due to the high risk of containment breach and the potential for catastrophic destruction, only limited and specific research is to be carried out on SCP-673. Any request for additional experiments must be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 staff members, and must demonstrate a compelling scientific or operational rationale.

## Notes

- It is hypothesized that SCP-673 may be of extraterrestrial origin, as no known terrestrial material exhibits such a destructive capability.
- Further research is ongoing to explore potential applications of SCP-673's anomalous properties, particularly in the field of waste disposal and resource extraction.
