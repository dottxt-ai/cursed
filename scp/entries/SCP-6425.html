        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
        <p><strong>Entry Type:</strong> Anomalous Software</p>

        <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Requirements:</strong> SCP-6425 is to be contained in a standard locked safe when not in use during testing.">&<|im_start|> assistant</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Access to SCP-6425 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. All use of SCP-6425 must be done within the confines of Site-17 during testing procedures approved by the Project Head. A log must be kept detailing all tests and experiments conducted using SCP-6425. No attempts to modify the software are to be made.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Instructions:</strong> SCP-6425 is to be treated as normal software and handled with standard precautions for digital data storage and transfer. Personnel are to be reminded that the anomalous effects of SCP-6425 are non-contagious, and conventional digital media will not be affected when used in conjunction with SCP-6425.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Precautions:</strong> No attempts to use SCP-64225 for information storage or transfer are to be conducted. Personnel are to be reminded that while the fractal patterns produced by SCP-6425 are visually pleasing, they exist solely as an anomaly and have no practical value.">&<|im_start|> assistant</li></ul><h2>Description</h2><p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> SCP-6425 is a commonly available, user-friendly professional-gradebling editing software, named 'Fractal Brush.' The software is available for both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. It is displayed in a common graphical user interface with options arranged in typical menus. Its icon is a cartoon-like image of a paintbrush with fractal patterns behind it in blue and purple shades.</p><p><strong>Anomalous Properties:</strong> When the software is opened and used to edit an image, the resulting image will display a number of 'glitches' and 'anomalies'. The glitches are instances of fractal patterns embedded within the image. These patterns are not noticeable to the unaided human eye, but appear as a stable overlay on top of the image when viewed with Fractal Brush. The fractal patterns seem to be specifically tailored to the original image, and the more detailed the original image, the more intricate the resulting patterns are.}</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> SCP-6425 was discovered in █████, France, on 11/12/2022, when Dr. ████ reported the anomaly to the Foundation during a routine check-up at Site-17. The software was discovered while investigating a local artist, Pierre Vidal, who had gained unexpected attention in the art world for his recent artworks. During the acquisition, it was discovered that SCP-6425 was the software used for the creation of Pierre's artworks.</p><p><strong>Relevant History:</strong> After acquisition of SCP-6425, multiple tests were conducted to study its anomalous effects. In particular, tests were done to determine whether the glitches and fractal patterns could be used for information transfer or data storage. However, it was found that no data other than the patterns themselves can be extracted from the images produced by the software. As a result, SCP-6425 is considered Safe.">&nbsp;</p><h2>Addenda</h2><h3>Addendum SCP-6425.1: Test Log 6425-01</h3><p>In Test Log 6425-01, SCP-6425 was used to modify a series of test images. The results were as follows:">&nbsp;</p><h3>Addendum SCP-6425.2: Test Log 6425-02</h3><p>In Test Log 6425-02, SCP-6425 was used to modify and analyze a series of testing photos. No new data or alterations in the images could be extracted other than the intricately fractal patterns. Consequently, it was confirmed that the information could not be stored or processed using the patterns with common computing techniques.</p>
