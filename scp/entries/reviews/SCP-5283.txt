### Initial Notes

The special containment procedures and description sections are clear and well-structured. I appreciate the inclusion of additional precautions, which highlights potential risks and necessary actions.

The entry could benefit from more vivid and engaging language in the special containment procedures and description sections to make it more captivating and easier to remember.

The addenda provide interesting details and examples to build a better understanding of SCP-5283's anomalous effects and potential applications.

The note about potential uses in counterintelligence seems out of place and could be moved to a separate document or properly integrated into the storyline.
