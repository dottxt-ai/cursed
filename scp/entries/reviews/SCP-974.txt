### Initial Notes

The entry seems well structured and easy to navigate, with clear headings for Special Containment Procedures, Description, and Addenda. The summary of SCP-974's properties and origin is brief but informative.

The entry could benefit from adding more specific details in some areas. For example, the physical appearance description could include information on the exact size, shape, or color of SCP-974, rather than just 'irregularly shaped'. Also, it would be interesting to have more context about why SCP-974 was designated as a potential threat to Earth's orbital stability.
