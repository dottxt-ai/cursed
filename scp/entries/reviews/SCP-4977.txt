### Initial Notes

Well-structured entry, with clear headings and sections. I appreciate the addition of the Addendum which provides an example of the anomaly's effect. The entry is detailed and descriptive, and the contained document idea is interesting and unique.

The initial description could benefit from additional context regarding why SCP-4977 is considered a threat and how its discovery led to the Foundation's containment. The Mandatory Security Measures section might be better placed under the 'Special Containment Procedures' heading for clarity.
