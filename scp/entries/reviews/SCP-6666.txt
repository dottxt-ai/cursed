## Review

### Initial Notes

The special containment procedures and description sections provide sufficient detail about the necessary precautions and requirements to contain SCP-6666.

The SCP-6666 description could benefit from an introduction that quickly summarizes its key features and anomalous properties. It also lacks context as to why this software is considered dangerous, even though it's mentioned in the last sentence of the description.

### Initial Review Score

6

### Review Reflection

Discuss ways to convey why the software is a threat to containment, and consider adding an introduction to the description to summarize its key features and behaviors.

### Final Review Score

7

### Publish Decision

True
