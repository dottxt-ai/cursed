## Review

### Initial Notes

The SCP entry has a clear and concise summary, consisting of Object Class, Entry Type, special containment procedures, security measures, and handling instructions. The description of the anomaly, origin and relevant history is well-written

The description could benefit from more specifics on the D-class subjects and their experiences within the created scenario, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of SCP-640's capabilities and limitations.

### Initial Review Score

6

### Review Reflection

The entry could provide more depth and clarity in describing the D-class subjects' experiences. It would be helpful to include additional Addenda to further detail the effects and its maintenance procedures, and to expand on attempts to understand its anomalous properties.

### Final Review Score
