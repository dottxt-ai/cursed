### Initial Notes

The SCP entry begins with a clear classification and containment procedures, which sets the foundation for subsequent information. The description of SCP-5960 is uniquely formatted as a suburban neighborhood, and the anomalous phenomenon is well-detailed.

The entry includes a comprehensive special containment procedures section, which outlines physical requirements, security measures, and handling instructions. The description section provides a clear and concise history of the object.

The entry includes an Addendum in the form of Agent ████'s diary entries. These entries, while adding an interesting personal perspective, are not specifically necessary for the functioning of the object, and may cloud the focus of the entry.
