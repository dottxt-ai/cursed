### Initial Notes

I appreciate the concise and organized structure of the SCP entry. The special containment procedures, description, and addenda are all clearly defined and easy to follow. However, the entry could benefit from additional context about the origins of SCP-4688 and possible consequences of its anomalous properties, aside from those mentioned in handing instructions.

This is the placeholder text in Addendum SCP-4688.1. Please provide actual recovered document details.

### Review Reflection

Consider providing more context and detail about the SCP-4688, maybe hinting at its origin, who created it, or why it has its anomalous properties. Explain the full consequences (if any) of the hourglass telling time in reverse. Fleshing out the recovered document could also be compelling by adding specific details or drama that the Foundation dealt with during that incident.

Remove the placeholder text and provide more details about the specific report or documentation that was recovered (4688-A) to make it come to life and keep readers engaged.
