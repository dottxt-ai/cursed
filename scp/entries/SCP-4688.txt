## Description

**Physical Appearance:** SCP-4688 appears as an old-fashioned brass hourglass with hourglass-shaped base, containing a total of approximately 430ml of sand. The sand appears to be of two distinct types, one half colored a deep, rich cinnamon while the opposite half is a vibrant Caribbean seafoam.  The hourglass bears no obvious means of identifiable origin or markings outside a faint circular etching on the base of the hourglass.

**Anomalous Properties:** Whenever the finer sand (seafoam) falls out of the hourglass, it does so from the bottom, replacing the coarser cinnamon sand up to the previous amount of the seafoam sand that fell. To the observer, it appears that the hourglass tells the time in reverse.

## Notes

- The effects of the SCP product mistakenly being sold in a local auction could have been a 'nightmare' for the town in which the Site-87 is located. The potential chaos had the seafoam sand run backwards time was averted due to the swift action of the Foundation security. This justifies the containment protocol that requires constant monitoring of the hourglass's whereabouts.
