# SCP-564

**Object Class:** Euclid
**Entry Type:** Artifact

## Special Containment Procedures

- **Physical Requirements:** SCP-564 is to be stored in a secure, temperature-controlled safe-class cell measuring 2 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters in height, lined with lead. The safe-class cell must be accessible only to Level 3 or higher Foundation personnel.
- **Security Measures:** Access to SCP-564 and its storage facility is to be monitored constantly. Any unauthorized access attempts must be reported immediately to Site Director.", "handling_instructions": "SCP-564 must be handled using non-metallic tools and gloves, and it must be cleaned and disinfected after each examination. No physical testing of SCP-564 is to be conducted without proper clearance from Level 4 personnel.", 
- **Handling Instructions:** SCP-564 must be handled using non-metallic tools and gloves, and it must be cleaned and disinfected after each examination. No physical testing of SCP-564 is to be conducted without proper clearance from Level 4 personnel.

## Description

**Physical Appearance:** SCP-564 is a small, irregularly-shaped artifact resembling a cross between a green bean and a potato, measuring 12.3 cm in length, 3.5 cm in diameter, and weighing 320 grams. Its outer surface is covered in grooves and small, irregularly-shaped protuberances. It is predominantly a dark olive green in color, with occasional speckles of red and black.

**Anomalous Properties:** SCP-564 possesses an anomalous attraction field that draws in metal objects and holds them in place, despite the metal objects' inherent magnetic properties. The effect's range extends approximately 50 cm from the surface of SCP-564.

**Origin:** SCP-564 was recovered in 1985 from a residential area in █████, Germany, along with several pieces of metal debris inexplicably attracted to SCP-564. The site of recovery had no known history or significance prior to the discovery of SCP-564.

**Relevant History:** Since its recovery, SCP-564 has been the subject of multiple experiments and tests in an attempt to determine its origins and the limits of its attraction capabilities. These tests have resulted in minimal advances in understanding the object's nature, and as such, further tests are to be conducted only after proper clearance from Level 4 personnel.

## Addenda

### Addendum SCP-564.1: Addendum 564-1

During a routine examination of SCP-564, Researcher Olsen attempted to inspect the object's interior with a metal screwdriver. Immediately upon touching the artifact with the screwdriver, Researcher Olsen was pulled towards SCP-564 and sustained severe refers to the artifact's anomalous attraction field that extends to organic material, including humans.

### Addendum SCP-564.2: Addendum 564-2

Following Incident 564-A, in which a D-class personnel was allowed to handle SCP-564 without proper precautions, the artifact mysteriously 'released' the D-class. It is still unknown why SCP-564 chose to release the D-class and no further attempts are to be made without proper clearance.

## Notes

- Further research is required to determine SCP-564's true capabilities and origins. Testing is to be conducted only after clearance from Level-4 personnel.
