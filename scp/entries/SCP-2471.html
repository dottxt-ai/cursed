        <h1>SCP-2471</h1>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Entry Type:</strong> Artifact</p>

        <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Requirements:</strong> The box is to be housed in a standard containment locker, monthly inspection by Level 2 personnel. The box is to be opened and its contents observed only by Level 4 personnel wearing gloves and facial protection to avoid possible biohazards from decomposed bodies that may be inside the box. Any new messages on the handwritten note are to be documented and immediately replaced with a blank note supplied by the Foundation.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> SCP-2471 is to be kept in a locked, tested secure containment locker within Site-77. Access to the object is to be granted only to Level 4 or higher personnel for experimentation purposes. All personnel involved in testing are to undergo psychological evaluations to ensure they can handle the potential psychological effects of interacting with the object.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Instructions:</strong> Personnel handling SCP-2471 are required to wear gloves and facial protection due to the danger of unknown contaminants, and also for the protection of the object. The box is to be opened only with care and minimal force, as the lid is fragile and can crack.</li>
        </ul><h2>Description</h2><p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> SCP-2471 appears to be an ancient, ornately carved wooden box with intricate patterns and symbols engraved on all surfaces. The box is approximately 30 centimeters long, 20 centimeters wide, and 15 centimeters high. The box is made of a yet-unidentified hardwood, dark in color and glossy. Its lid is hinged and secured by a pair of brass clasps. Inside the box, there is a velvet-like lining that seems to be untainted by age or wear. On the top of the box, a plaque is engraved with the symbol 'R' in an unknown script. A small, handwritten note on parchment is found inside the box at the time of recovery.</p><p><strong>Anomalous Properties:</strong> The contents of SCP-2471 appear to be static when observed, but upon statistical analysis, it is revealed that the items within are constantly shifting. Each item will always be in its proper place as if it were stationary when viewed individually, but as soon as two or more items are compared, they have shifted positions. The handwritten note found within the box disappears and reappears in the same location, but with a different message each time it is found.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> SCP-2471 was discovered in an underground chamber in Egypt by a Foundation archaeological expedition in 1956. It was found alongside several decomposed bodies, each holding in their hands an identical box resembling SCP-2471. It appears that the owners were attempting to place an object into the box before their untimely demise.</p><p><strong>Relevant History:</strong> SCP-2471 was initially classified as Safe but was later reclassified as Euclid due to the unpredictable nature of the contents and the mysterious note. Efforts to determine the contents of the box by various means of imaging have failed, as the shifting nature of the contents obscures any attempt at visualization. The box itself does not appear to be anomalous, but further research is necessary. This object is a high priority for the Foundation due to its potential impact on local history and belief systems.</p><h2>Addenda</h2><h3>Addendum SCP-2471.1: Addendum 2471-01</h3><p>During an experiment with SCP-2471, a researcher opened the box and briefly observed the contents. As soon as the researcher had turned his attention to the anomalous note, the contents of the box had seemingly shifted. As he reached in to correct his observation, he felt a painful sting on his hand, and a small crawfish emerged from his glove. The crawfish was a commonly observed species in the Nile river and was deemed harmless. After the experiment, the researcher was examined by medical staff, but no further effects were observed.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Further investigation is needed to determine the reason behind the decomposed bodies, the message on the note, and the shifting nature of the contents. The box itself might hold an unknown energy source that affects the items inside and prevents them from stopping their movement. The contents, if stabilized, might reveal important information about the past of the region around the discovery site.</li></ul>
