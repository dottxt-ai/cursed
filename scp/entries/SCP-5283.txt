# SCP-5283

**Object Class:** Euclid
**Entry Type:** Anomalous Software

## Special Containment Procedures

- **Physical Requirements:** Document A and all replicated instances of SCP-5283 must be stored on a dedicated server within a<|im_start|><|im_start|> assistanticular containment chamber. Access to the server is restricted to Level 3 personnel with proper clearance. Regular system scans must be performed to ensure no instances of SCP-5283 have managed to escape the server.
- **Security Measures:** Personnel are required to use dedicated, secure workstations when working with SCP-5283. Any digital devices brought into the containment area must be scanned for the presence of SCP-5283 prior to entry and after exit. Any device found to be contaminated with SCP-5283 must be isolated and wiped immediately.
- **Handling Instructions:** When handling SCP-5283, personnel must exercise extreme care and avoid typing any words or phrases that could be considered dangerous or sensitive. Personnel must not use Document A for any personal use, and must report any instances of SCP-5283-induced notifications or pop-ups immediately.
- **Additional Precautions:** Due to the potential for SCP-5283 to be weaponized, personnel must avoid using Document A to type messages or notifications that could be perceived as hostile or targeted. All outgoing communications from the Foundation's network are to be monitored for any signs of SCP-5283-induced text.

## Description

**Physical Appearance:** SCP-5283 is an anomalous software program that appears as a commonly-used word processing application, which will be referred to as "Document A" for the sake of clarity. Document A contains all the standard features expected from a word processor, such as text formatting, spell-checker, and document saving. The user interface of Document A is virtually identical to that of commonly used word processors.

**Anomalous Properties:** When a user opens Document A and types a phrase or sentence, the document will respond as expected, with no noticeable anomalies. However, after the user closes Document A, any text that was typed into the program will appear in proximity to the user's mobile device, computer, or any other digital device that can display text. The text will appear as a notification, pop-up window, or even in other open programs, in a manner similar to malware infection. The text will appear in the same language and font as it was written in Document A and will not disappear unless manually removed by the user.

**Origin:** SCP-5283 was discovered in ██/██/20██, when several Foundation agents reported their personal computers and mobile devices being affected by seemingly malicious text messages, pop-ups, and notifications. Further investigation led to the discovery of Document A on one of the agents' devices, which was subsequently contained.

**Relevant History:** Since its containment, Document A has been replicated multiple times, with each instance assigned a unique identification number: SCP-5283-1, SCP-5283-2, and so on. The Foundation has implemented protocols to prevent the spread of SCP-5283 and to monitor any attempts at misuse. Several incidents have occurred, with individuals attempting to weaponize SCP-5283 by spreading targeted text through public channels. These attempts have been thwarted, but the risk of SCP-5283's misuse remains a concern.

## Addenda

### Addendum SCP-5283.1: Document-A-01

Log of SCP-5283-related incidents: "`In case of breach, activate Protocol Epsilon."` appeared on the personal devices of Researcher ███ Marx just before he initiated Protocol Epsilon during a simulation. The text was later found to be an SCP-5283 incident.

### Addendum SCP-5283.2: Document-A-02

Memo regarding SCP-5283's potential use in counterintelligence operations.

## Notes

- It has been theorized that SCP-5283 is a manifestation of a highly advanced information-based entity, utilizing modern digital technology to spread its "words". However, this theory remains unconfirmed and is currently under investigation.
