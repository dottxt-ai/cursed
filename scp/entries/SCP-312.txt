# SCP-312

## Item #: SCP-312

## Object Class: [Euclid]

## Special Containment Procedures

SCP-312 is stored in a standard humanoid containment locker located within Site-15's sealed Wing C.

Access to SCP-312 is restricted to Level 3 personnel with approval from Site Director. Personnel entering Wing C must wear biohazard suits and are prohibited from directly handling SCP-312.

Any items contaminated by SCP-312 are to be decontaminated immediately.

Researchers are to monitor SCP-312 for signs of infection, and any display of anomalous abilities will result in a containment breach registration.

## Description:

SCP-312 appears as a humanoid entity resembling a 30-year-old Caucasian male. It stands approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 75 kg. SCP-312 suffers from a severe case of albinism, and its skin is translucent, allowing internal organs to be visible.

SCP-312 is able to transfer a fatal, contagious disease to humans through physical contact. The incubation period of the disease is approximately 2 days, after which the infected individual will develop flu-like symptoms that rapidly progress to death within 72 hours. The disease appears to be highly contagious, with exposure to infected individuals or contaminated objects resulting in infection. However, an individual infected with the disease does not display any abnormal symptoms, allowing them to unknowingly spread the disease.

## Notes:

Further research into possible treatments or a cure for the disease is ongoing, though no breakthroughs have been made.
