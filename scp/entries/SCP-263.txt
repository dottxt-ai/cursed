# SCP-263

## Item #: SCP-263

## Object Class: [Euclid]

## Special Containment Procedures

SCP-263 is housed within a hermetically-sealed 2.5 m x 2.5 m x 2.5 m enclosure constructed of non-conductive, non-corrosive materials. The enclosure is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell.

The enclosure is to be monitored by video surveillance 24 hours a day, with live feeds accessed by authorized personnel only.

Personnel handling SCP-263 are required to wear full-body Hazmat suits level A, equipped with a positive pressure respirator with HEPA filter.

Authorized personnel are to inform Security team of any unusual behavior detected by the surveillance system.

## Description:

SCP-263 appears as a humanoid figure approximately 2 meters tall with an androgynous appearance. Its skin is a metallic silver color, without any visible pores, hair, or orifices. SCP-263 has a single, large, crescent-shaped eye in the center of its chest, which appears to be the only functioning sensory organ. It possesses a pair of skin flaps which extend from its shoulders to its waist, reminiscent of wings, but lacking any apparent musculature. SCP-263 lacks discernible genitalia.

When SCP-263's eye makes visual contact with a person, the person will immediately lose all bodily function and enter a state of suspended animation. The person will remain in this state indefinitely, only returning to normal upon SCP-263's eye losing sight of the affected individual. The victim's body remains functional and resilient while in the suspended state, allowing them to survive otherwise fatal situations.

The object was discovered in 1985, amid a bunch of undelivered packages, sent from an unknown facility to a now defunct courier company in Berlin, Germany.

SCP-263's containment was breached on 25/02/1998. The incident resulted in 4 casualties. The Foundation liaised with local authorities and downplayed the event as a biological hazard incident. After an extensive search, SCP-263 was recovered and containment procedures were tightened.

## Addendum:

### Addendum SCP-263.1: Addendum 263-1

During a test in which researchers approached SCP-263 to within 10 meters, the metal of SCP-263's body spontaneously emitted a loud high-pitched noise, causing all non-Hazmat personnel within 20 meters to suffer temporary hearing loss.

## Notes:

It is currently unknown how the absence of bodily functions in affected individuals can prevent fatal situations while maintaining otherwise normal functionality.
