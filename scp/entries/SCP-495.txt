# SCP-495

## Item #: SCP-495

## Object Class: [Euclid]

## Special Containment Procedures

SCP-495 is to be stored inside a standard humanoid containment cell with an attached personal reading area."

Access to SCP-495 is limited to Level 3 personnel with special clearance. Any instances of SCP-495-1 are to be terminated immediately upon discovery on site.

Personnel interacting with SCP-495 are advised to maintain proper guidelines and cautions, as SCP-495 has shown to exhibit the anomalous effects.

All experimental logs and records must be stored in a secure safe-class locker on site.

## Description:

SCP-495 is a standard, mass-production copy of Jules Verne's novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'. The markings and labeling on the book are unremarkable, with the exception of the author and title being printed in a gold embossment on the red leather binding.

When an individual reads SCP-495, they enter an alternate dimension, where the events in '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' exist as reality. The individual, henceforth referred to as SCP-495-1, is unable to be located by normal tracking methods, including radar, GPS, mobile phones, and any other forms of communication. The individual can only be returned to the original dimension by physically opening to a random page in said copy of the book. Reading other versions of '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' does not induce the same effect.

SCP-495 was discovered in a small, family-owned bookstore in Paris, France, during routine Foundation book surveying.

Since its containment in 1965, there have been over 121 instances of SCP-495-1.

## Addendum:

### Addendum SCP-495.1: Addendum-495-A

An experiment was conducted where 15 instances of D-class personnel were instructed to read SCP-495 simultaneously, within a secure containment chamber. All 15 D-class personnel were dispatched as SCP-495-1. Recovery teams were sent to locate SCP-495-1 instances, but were unsuccessful in doing so. This experiment was terminated due to heavy Foundation casualties and an overwhelming number of SCP-495-1.

### Addendum SCP-495.2: Addendum-495-B

As of 03/22/2010, during a routine inspection of SCP-495, the author's signature was found to be slightly different than the original gold embossed signature. Foundation researchers were unable to identify the new signature.

## Notes:

Authorities should be on high alert in the Medusa Region of the Pacific Ocean, as multiple instances of SCP-495-1 have been found in the vicinity.
