        <h1>SCP-4977</h1>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Entry Type:</strong> Documentation-Affecting SCP</p>

        <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Requirements:</strong> SCP-4977 is stored in a standard contained document locker at Site-87. Access to SCP-4977 requires Level 3 or higher clearance and authorization from the Site Director. Researchers are permitted to access SCP-4977 only under specific containment procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> All those granted access to SCP-4977 are required to wear specialized optical scanners whichEm display the content of the entries to individual users. The reader can see the entry as it was originally written, and no other individual can see their displayed entry. Each researcher is allowed to view only one entry per session, with a 24-hour cooldown period between sessions to monitor for any residual effects from the previous entry read.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Instructions:</strong> In the event that an entry in SCP-4977 causes significant disruption, the entry must be immediately sealed by the optical scanner and reported to the Site Director. If any researcher displays symptoms that could be related to a past entry read, they must be immediately isolated and given medical treatment until the effects subside or are neutralized.</li>
        </ul><h2>Description</h2><p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> SCP-4977 is a vintage leather-bound journal, measuring 8 x 11 inches when closed. The cover is maroon with gold tooling along the edges and a central design featuring an astronomical symbol reminiscent of astrology. The journal pages are made of thick, off-white acid-free paper, with a ribbon bookmark inserted and a black metal clasp to keep it closed.</p><p><strong>Anomalous Properties:</strong> Whenever a person reads an entry in SCP-4977, the event described in that entry will occur in reality, as if it were an actual memory, with the reader being the first person to experience the event. The effects vary depending on the content of the entry, ranging from relatively benign occurrences to severe disruptions in reality. The frequency of the events is directly proportional to the number of people who read the entry and the length of time the entry is read.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> SCP-4977 was discovered in the debris of an abandoned library in █████ County, Albania. Research indicated that the journal was created in the early 19th century by an individual who called themselves 'Elias'. The entries in the journal reveal a series of temporal experiments, the results of which led to the creation of the anomaly.</p><p><strong>Relevant History:</strong> During initial testing, subjects were instructed to read a single entry aloud. The event described in the entry occurred shortly thereafter. The Foundation contained the journal and relocated it to Site-87, assigning a dedicated research team to study the anomaly and develop means of safe extraction of information from the journal.</p><h2>Addenda</h2><h3>Addendum SCP-4977.1: Journal Entry-012</h3><p>Upon opening the journal to the 12th entry, the first five words of the entry became smudged as if they had been wiped away. Researchers are unable to read the affected words.</p><h3>Addendum SCP-4977.2: Journal Entry-104</h3><p>When one researcher read this entry, they reported experiencing a sharp pain in their upper abdomen accompanied by symptoms of mild food poisoning. The discomfort lasted for approximately 24 hours. Upon review, the researcher discovered that they had chosen to read an entry detailing a food poisoning incident.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Despite the potentially dangerous anomaly within SCP-4977, researchers have discovered that thejournal reveals important historical information about temporal experimentation in the early 19th century. The Foundation is currently attempting to extract this information safely while mitigating the risks posed by the anomaly.</li></ul>
